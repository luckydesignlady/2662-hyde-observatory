    <h3>About Hyde Programs</h3>
    <p>Programs last about 20 minutes with 20 minutes pauses in between so patrons can look through the telescopes between programs. Usually two programs are shown alternating throughout the evening. One of the programs is always a slideshow about the current season's constellations</p>

    <h3>The Celestron 14</h3>
    <p>Our largest telescope is the C14, a 14 inch aperture f/11 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope produced by Celestron. The vintage 1976 telescope is mounted on the original fork with a Byers drive system in the base. The telescope can be moved with a push of a button to scan around local regions of the sky, or just unlocked and moved by hand from object to object. The instrument is ideal for high-power views of the moon and planets, as well as for viewing double stars and many faint deep-sky objects like star clusters, planetary nebulae, and even a few galaxies. The telescope has also been used for Astronomy class work and astrophotography.</p>
